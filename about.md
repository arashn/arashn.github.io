My name is Arash Nabili. I was born in Tehran, Iran. In 2003, when I was eleven, I immigrated with my family to the United States, after spending nearly two years in Turkey. In 2010, I graduated from Cottonwood High School in Salt Lake City, Utah. I attended UC Irvine for my undergraduate studies, and in 2016, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at UC Irvine.  I am studying the effects of vehicular networks on traffic throughput and vehicle safety, in the context of autonomous vehicles. My advisor is Professor Amelia Regan.

My hobbies are hiking, weightlifting, and reading. I also like coding (believe it or not). I like to travel and explore the world, although I haven’t been able to do so lately.

I love music. I like listening Persian and American music in a variety of genres, like Persian classical music, pop, Persian and American rap, and rock. I redesigned the Android app for Radio Javan, a Persian music website, to provide a better listening experience for fans of Persian music. I also like playing guitar from time to time. I believe that the right music can uplift the human soul.

I love my home country of Iran. While I only lived in Iran for the first ten years of my life, I have many fond memories of living there and being with my cousins and relatives. At the same time, I feel blessed to be in the United States, and to have the opportunity to reach my dreams. Had I stayed in Iran, my life would have been very different than what it is now. I would not have been able to attend college, for being a Baha’i, and my career opportunities would be severely limited. I am forever indebted to my parents for their decision to immigrate to the US, sacrificing their livelihood in Iran so that my brother and I could have a better future.

##### Fun facts:
My parents are of Sangesari origin. [Sangesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehdishahr) is a city in northern Iran. The language of their people is Sangesari, a language that has its roots in ancient Persian, and that has withstood most of the changes that Persian has seen until now. Sangesari also has one of the largest vocabularies of any language in the world, with about 17,000 words. I can understand a bit of Sangesari, but I've made it a goal to learn Sangesari well. I believe that if there are many Sangesaris like me not knowing their mother tongue, the language will eventually die, just like Latin.
