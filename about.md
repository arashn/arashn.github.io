My name is Arash Nabili. I was born in Tehran, Iran. In 2003, when I was eleven, I immigrated with my family to the United States, after spending nearly two years in Turkey. In 2010, I graduated from Cottonwood High School in Salt Lake City, Utah. I attended UC Irvine for my undergraduate studies, and in 2016, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently a PhD student in Computer Science at UC Irvine.  I am studying the effects of vehicular networks on traffic throughput and vehicle safety, in the context of autonomous vehicles. My advisor is Professor Amelia Regan.
