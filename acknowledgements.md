I would like to acknowledge all who have helped me reach my dreams.

I am incredibly thankful for my advisor, Professor [Amelia Regan](http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/aregan/). She has stood by my side and supported me every step of the way through my graduate studies. I am also grateful for my longtime mentors and dear friends, Professors [Frank Vahid](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~vahid/) and [Tony Givargis](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~givargis/). They both have tirelessly supported and advised me throughout my career. I am forever indebted to them for their generosity and support. Without their help, I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today.

I am thankful for my parents and my brother for supporting me all of my life, and for their sacrifices for me to pursue my dreams. I dedicate my life and works to them.

I would like to give a special thanks to my dear friend and colleague, [Dr. Pooria Yaghini](http://newport.eecs.uci.edu/~pooriam/). His mentorship and support in recent years has been greatly influential in my career.

Finally, I thank all of my friends and family for their kindness and support.
