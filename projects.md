#### Senior Design Project
##### CSE 181, Fall 2015 - Spring 2016
Designed an autonomous campus guide drone capable of navigating the user to a desired building on campus.  
The drone system has two components: mobile app and server. The mobile app is used by the user to request a drone and to specify the desired building, either on a map or by using the building code (e.g. DBH for Donald Bren Hall). The server is responsible for taking the user's request and sending the appropriate flight path to the drone. It takes the user's current location, the drone's current location, and the desired building, and uses Google Maps to determine a path for the drone to take. It then creates a flight path consisting of coordinates, or waypoints, for the drone to fly through, and sends the flight plan to the drone.

#### Computer Architecture Lab - Class Project
##### CSE 132L Winter 2016
Designed a 32-bit MIPS processor in VHDL. As the team leader, I orchestrated project tasks among the team members, and oversaw the integration of the different components developed (controller, register file, 32-bit ALU, ROM, etc.)
