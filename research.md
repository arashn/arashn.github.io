My research is focused on studying the effects of incorporating vehicular networks into autonomous vehicles on road throughput and vehicle safety. I believe that by enabling communication between autonomous vehicles, we can increase traffic flow efficiency and safety of all vehicles.

I am aiming to work on developing a platform for cooperative driving, which would integrate V2X (vehicle-to-everything) networks with other sensors on autonomous vehicles. This platform would provide a flexible framework for defining rules of traffic, and communication protocols among vehicles and roadside units (RSUs). This framework would allow for easy modification of rules, vehicle sensor design, and other parameters and components of the system. In this way, vehicle communications would be possible and interoperable between vehicles from different manufacturers. Ultimately, I envision this platform being integrated into a future Internet of Everything infrastructure in a smart city setting.

In April 2018, I was awarded the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship ([NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org)) to continue my research efforts in this field.
